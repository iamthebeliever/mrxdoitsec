What is IP?
IP is a number used for addressing networked devices. It is devided in 4 octect total bit size = 32.

What is a mac address?
in computing it is defined as hexadecimal number like 3d:2e:44:c5:d9:1b bit size = 48.

IP vs Mac
IP is like your postal address and mac is you.

Subnet Mask
It is the maximum rage of ips inside a subnet.

Private IPs
10.0.0.0 -- 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 -- 172.31.255.255
198.168.0.0 -- 198.168.255.255

CMD Challenge
whoami & ping 8.8.8.8 //it will execute both commands
whoami && ping 8.8.8.8 //if first command fails then the next command will be rejected
//
whoami | ping 8.8.8.8 //it will execute both commands
whoami || ping 8.8.8.8 //if first command succeed then the next command will be rejected

Open Redirection == Invalidated Redirects and Forwards
in this attack the URL of a request made by a user changes without generating status code 301 and 302.

Insecure Deserialization == Object Injection
It happens when malformed/malfunctioned data is deserialized and processed by the applications.

Missing Function Level Access Control
This is a type of Broken Access Control, it happens during privileges escalation when an existing user of an application is able to access restricted functionalities.
Example - Horizontal PE, Vertical PE.

Indirect Object Reference
It is type of broken access control vunerability, it happens when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.
Example - 
https://insecure-website.com/customer_account?customer_number=132355/
https://insecure-website.com/static/12144.txt

Client Side Authentication
Authentication is done at client side using programming language and plain text or stored credentials.

Server Side Authentication
Authentication is done at server side using server programming languages and database server.

How to test csrf

Intercept request/manipulate token/send request/test if token is strictly implemented or not/gerenrate poc from engagement tools/deploy the code/expolit

Client Side Language

Javascript/HTML/VBScript

Server Side Language

PHP/JSP/ASP

Encryption
Plain text into cipher text is encryption

Types
Symmetric/Asymmetric

Symmetric
Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data by senders and receivers. Key is sent first before the encrypted data.

Asymmetric
This uses public key to send encrypt data and receiver decrypt this data using its private key.

Symmetric VS Asymmetric

Both provides higher confidentiality but their use denpends on the situations. when speed is required then symmetric encryption is best when more privacy is required then asymmetric is best. Suppose there is a very big amount of data to encrypt and decrypt then using asymmetric it will take longer time in comparing to symmetric.

Key should be trasmitted with symmetric encryption, asymmetric doesn't require it - user already has its private key to decrypt the message. Suppose there are so many transactions then there should be so many request to send symmetric keys.

Security and confidentiality - in both encryption confidentiality is high, but security is somewhat weak or risky in case of symmetric, because no channel is completely secure, means symmetric keys can be captured if channel is not secure. But this is not possible with asymmetric encryption.

SQLi
injecting some sql commands based statements in input fields or manipulating a url using some sql commands like order by, union or ',//,#.

XSS
it is an scritping attack which uses client side scripting to retrieve cookies, session-ids, tokens and other useful information.

SSH
it is used to remotly access networked devices for testing and configuration over ssl

SMB
it is used to share files between linux and windows

LDAPi
LDAP is a protocol used to provide web based directory access, it process directory database so it is used to perform LDAP injections by adversaries.

XMLi
xml injection is done over xml database

OS Command Injection
is done by accessing target's command shell to execute commands by the adversaries

XXE
is done by defining an external entity inside xml document by adversaries

SSRF
a request is done by server to access server resources initiated by the adversaries

CSRF
a request is done from client side without his intentions initiated by the adversaries

SST
small codes written inside the brackets either <> or {} is template. the code is processed at server side and result is displayed at client side. it is to add dynamic properties to the html documents.
Example - Hello {{user.name}} Example - <%=100+100 %>

X-Forwarded-Host --> standard header for identifying the original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header.

X-Forwarded-For --> standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.

X-Forwarded-Proto --> standard header for identifying the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your proxy or load balancer.

Referer Header --> address of the page which generates the request

Origin Header --> <scheme>://<hostname>:<port>

X-Frame-Options --> deny/same-origin/allow-form-uri

Content-Security-Policy --> response header allows web site administrators to control resources that the user agent is allowed to load for a given page

Same-Origin-Policy --> is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin

Cookie Flags

Expire --> it defines that after a particular time cookie will expire.

HttpOnly --> it disables client side javascript only for accessing cookies.

Secure --> it is used to ensure that cookie will only be transmitted over https.

Path --> it defines the path for which cookie is assigned

Domain --> it defines the domain for which cookie is assigned

SameSite --> it is used to protecting sites to access cookies, i.e. strict value always protects other sites to access the cookies of a particular domain, lax will allow other sites to access cookies such as authentication cookies, and none for same origin or cors or everything.
